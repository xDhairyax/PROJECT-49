  <p>WHAT IS ORIGAMI?</p>
  <p>Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China. It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.
    Earliest records of origami indicate that it was used primarily for religious or ceremonial reasons. Eventually, as people became more interested in it, origami was used for decorative and artistic purposes. It was also used as a tool to teach basic principles of math and geometry.
